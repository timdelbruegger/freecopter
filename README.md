# Freecopter - An autonomous Quadrocopter project powered by a Raspberry Pi2

At the moment, the project is rebooting. You can find current development information in my blog: https://timdelbruegger.wordpress.com/

### Folders:
- *modelling:* mathematical ideas that support the source code.
- *hardware_checks:* Scripts that check the functionality of individual hardware components (normally in Python 3).
